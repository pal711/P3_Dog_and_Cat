# P3_Dog_and_Cat
## About
The project is about creating a binary classifier which classifies a picture either as a Cat picture or as a DOg picture. So the model learns to distinguish between dogs and cats. <br>

## Dataset
The data is collected from Kaggle [Dogs vs Cats kaggle challange](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). Unfortunately the test labels are not available. I have labeled aroung 200 images manually for the test data.

## Model and Training 
Well I have done lot of training in Google Colab environment. <br> I have created 2 models with similar architecture but the second model performed better. I have trained the second model mostly on Google Colab then loaded the saved weights and fine tuned the model with smaller learnign rate.

## Results
As the labels are not availablel I have labeled 200 test images by hand and got accuracy of 86%.
